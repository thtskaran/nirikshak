### **Team Name**

Ingenico

### **Theme**

AI for Good, SafeTech+

## **Short Description**

Nirikshak is an advanced, offline large language model (LLM)-powered logging and monitoring system designed to provide deep, real-time insights into application and infrastructure logs. By leveraging the analytical capabilities of LLMs locally, Nirikshak enables organizations to detect anomalies, summarize trends, and generate actionable alerts \- all without compromising data privacy or requiring internet connectivity.

## **Problem Statement**

In today’s digital landscape, organizations across sectors generate enormous volumes of logs from applications, servers, and infrastructure. These logs are critical for maintaining system health, ensuring security, and troubleshooting incidents. However, extracting meaningful insights from such vast and often unstructured data is a significant challenge. Traditional logging and monitoring solutions are frequently limited to basic keyword searches and rule-based alerts, which can miss subtle anomalies or fail to provide actionable intelligence.

Moreover, many industries \- including finance, healthcare, and government \- operate under strict data privacy and compliance regulations. These requirements often prohibit sending sensitive logs to cloud-based analytics platforms, forcing organizations to rely on less sophisticated, on-premises solutions that lack advanced analytical capabilities.

Key challenges faced by users and industries include:

* **Limited Insight**: Existing tools struggle to interpret unstructured logs, making it difficult to detect emerging issues or patterns.  
* **Delayed Response**: Manual analysis and basic alerting can result in slow incident detection and response, increasing operational risk.  
* **Data Privacy Concerns**: Cloud-based AI analytics are often not an option due to regulatory and security constraints, leaving a gap in intelligent, offline solutions.  
* **Operational Complexity**: Managing and analyzing logs from diverse sources without advanced automation increases the workload on IT and DevOps teams.

There is a clear need for an intelligent, privacy-preserving, and offline system that can analyze logs in real time, identify anomalies, and provide actionable recommendations \- empowering organizations to maintain secure, reliable operations without compromising data privacy.

## **Proposed Solution**

Unified Log Collection and Ingestion:

Nirikshak uses open-source agents (such as Fluentd or OpenTelemetry) to collect logs from diverse sources—applications, servers, network devices, and cloud services. These logs are ingested into a centralized, on-premise database for secure storage and further analysis.

Offline LLM-Powered Analysis:

At the core, Nirikshak leverages locally deployed open-source LLMs (like Llama 2 or Mistral) to parse, classify, and analyze unstructured log data. Unlike traditional tools that rely on rigid pattern matching, LLMs can understand the semantic and contextual nuances of log entries, regardless of their format or source. This enables the system to detect issues, summarize trends, and identify root causes—even when log syntax varies widely.

Template Detection and Pattern Reuse:

To ensure scalability and efficiency, Nirikshak combines AI-driven analysis with semantic heuristics and pattern fingerprinting. Common log patterns are detected and cached, allowing the system to reuse templates for similar logs and reduce computational overhead. This approach ensures fast, economical processing even at high log volumes.

Real-Time Observability and Visualization:

Integrated with open-source observability platforms like SigNoz, Grafana, and Prometheus, Nirikshak provides real-time dashboards for metrics, log trends, and anomaly alerts. Users can visualize system health, track performance, and quickly identify operational issues through intuitive charts and graphs.

Automated Anomaly Detection and Alerts:

The system continuously monitors logs for unusual patterns, errors, or security threats. LLMs’ contextual understanding allows Nirikshak to detect subtle anomalies that rule-based systems might miss, and to trigger automated alerts for rapid incident response.

Security and Privacy by Design:

All analysis is performed locally, ensuring sensitive data never leaves the organization’s control. The system supports masking and redaction of personally identifiable information (PII/PHI) and maintains immutable audit trails for compliance and forensic analysis.

Continuous Learning and Feedback:

Nirikshak incorporates a feedback loop where human operators can validate or correct LLM outputs, enabling the models to improve over time and adapt to evolving log patterns and operational contexts.

High-Level Workflow:

1. Logs are collected from various sources and ingested into a secure, centralized repository.  
2. Offline LLMs analyze logs for structure, content, and context, detecting anomalies and extracting key information.  
3. Identified patterns are cached and reused for efficiency.  
4. Real-time dashboards and automated alerts provide actionable insights to IT and security teams.  
5. Human feedback is used to refine the system and ensure continuous improvement.

   * Fine-tune models on synthetic or redacted log data to improve template detection accuracy (e.g., using ULog’s unsupervised methods).  
3. Log Processing Pipeline:  
   * Template Detection: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., hierarchical clustering) and LLM-TD’s batch processing to identify log templates.  
   * Anomaly Detection: Use LLMs to flag deviations from normal patterns (e.g., unexpected error spikes, security breaches).  
   * Summarization: Generate daily/weekly reports highlighting critical events, performance bottlenecks, and compliance gaps.  
4. Observability & Alerts:  
   * Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and Prometheus+Grafana for real-time dashboards.  
   * Deploy NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails to filter sensitive data leaks or malicious prompts.  
5. Feedback Loop:
